# Team-Project-DSML
This is a The Feature Engineers repository used for sharing of all the files that we use in the Team Project Assignment in the subject Data Science and Machine Learning on University of Cologne.

The dataset files are available on this link: https://uni-koeln.sciebo.de/s/ZOdCfXORDTeGnlF (they are too big for git -> you have to add them to your folder to which you have cloned this repository)

Other files regarding the instructions and resources for the Team Assignment can be found in this repository.

We will use the predefined notebooks for each of the steps [1), 2), 3)...] where we will share the code. Of course feel free to create other Notebooks were you can work on different tasks to your liking, although the final working code should be commited through the numbered notebooks.

Disclaimer: I have never used git nor have I ever programmed anything prior to the Erasmus exchange, therefore any feedback (positive or negative) is welcome either through the Whatsapp group or here on git.hub
